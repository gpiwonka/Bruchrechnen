Part 2 of the series Learning programs with Python

To practice and learn fractions, we can develop a fractions quiz. Here we want to generate random fractions and let the user calculate the result.

The quiz program can be divided into functions to make the code more concise and improve reusability. There are functions like "fraction()" to generate a random fraction, "answer_calculate()" to check the result of a calculation, and "parse_fraction()" to convert the user's input into a fraction.

The main() function can display the welcome, set the number of questions and the operator, loop to ask the questions, check the user input, and update the user's score.

The fractions quiz program uses the Fraction library in Python to work with fractions, and the Random library to generate random fractions and operators.
